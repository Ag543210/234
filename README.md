# Randomizer.Generator
The infinitely customizable random content generator.

### What is The Randomizer? ###
---
* The Randomizer is the Infinitely Customizeable Random Content Generator.  It was designed with role playing game players and writers in mind though it is far from limited to those folks.
* There are several different components to The Randomizer:
  * **Randomizer.Generator** the engine behind The Randomizer.  It contains a number of classes for generating content using different types of generators.
  * **Randomizer.Generator.Test** unit tests for the Randomizer.Generator project
  * **Randomizer.Generator.CmdLine** a command line tool to generate content.
  * **Randomizer.Generator.UI.MVC** an MVC Core web application for generating content.
  * **Randomizer.Generator.UI.Terminal** a terminal gui to generate content.  Designed to work on Windows, Mac, Unix, and Linux.
  * **Randomizer.Generator.DefinitionConverter** a command line tool to convert old grammar files to the new dictionary format

**Everyone**
I love seeing custom grammars and libraries written by users to add to the growing list.  If you develop a new grammar that you think anyone else might like, please submit it to the [Customizations Repository](https://github.com/melance/TheRandomizerWPFCustomizations) or send it to me a message here via my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/melance).

**Translators**
Planned for the future.
