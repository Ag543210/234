# Randomizer.Generator
The infinitely customizable random content generator.

### What is The Randomizer? ###
---
* The Randomizer is the Infinitely Customizeable Random Content Generator.  It was designed with role playing game players and writers in mind though it is far from limited to those folks.
* There are several different components to The Randomizer:

| Component | Use | File |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Randomizer.Generator** | the engine behind The Randomizer.  It contains a number of classes for generating content using different types of generators. | Rnd.Gen.dll |
| **Randomizer.Generator.Test** | unit tests for the Randomizer.Generator project | _N/A_ |
| **Randomizer.Generator.CmdLine** | a command line tool to generate content. | Rnd.Gen.CLI.exe |
| **Randomizer.Generator.UI.MVC** | an MVC Core web application for generating content. Currently not available. | _N/A_ |
| **Randomizer.Generator.UI.Terminal** | a terminal gui to generate content.  Designed to work on Windows, Mac, Unix, and Linux. | Rnd.Gen.UIT.exe |
| **Randomizer.Generator.DefinitionConverter** | a command line tool to convert old grammar files to the new dictionary format | Rnd.Gen.Conv.exe |
