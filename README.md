**Everyone**
I love seeing custom grammars and libraries written by users to add to the growing list.  If you develop a new grammar that you think anyone else might like, please submit it to the [Customizations Repository](https://github.com/melance/TheRandomizerWPFCustomizations) or send it to me a message here via my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/melance).

**Translators**
Planned for the future.

**Developers**
I'm always looking for new developers to contribute to the cause.  I have a number of grand ideas on the horizon for the project that can always use help if you are interested.
